Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

#### About me:
I am an aspiring developer, currently busy doing a career change. I am moving from a career in supply chain management to a career in tech!
I am passionate about coding and am enthusiastic to keep learning as much as possible to develop myself into a world class developer.
I'm currently learning front end development, which involves learning about numerous technologies and how to apply them practically. 
I have been learning, and am familiar with, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, React.js, and Git. I also have a working knowledge of SQL and am set on learning Python next.


#### Skills:

* JavaScript
* HTML, CSS
* Node
* React
* Git
* SQL


#### My Projects:
*As I am still new to this, I will be adding more projects to this page in the coming weeks as I develop more programs that I am proud of showcasing.* 

To start with, here is the most recent project I have worked on 
- **[Project 1](https://github.com/robbinwilson24/finalCapstone)** - A basic offline webpage, made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Featuring a selection of connected pages that showcases my understanding of the previously mentioned languages. This will be improved upon as my skills develop.
